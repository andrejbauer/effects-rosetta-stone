# Effects and handlers rosetta stone

## About the repository

The participants of Dagstuhl seminar [Algebraic effect handlers go
mainstream](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=18172)
(April 22â€“27, 2018) have initiated this repository of examples that show how to
program with algebraic effects and handlers in various languages.

The repository contains a number of examples, starting from very simple ones
that are meant to demonstrate the similarities and differences between
implementations of algebraic effects, all the way to more sophisticated
challenges and benchmarks.

### How to contribute

Will be written.

## Examples

### Basic examples

Educational examples that help explain algebraic effects and handlers.


### Advanced examples

Examples which demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of algebraic effects
and handlers.

### Problematics examples

Examples which are typically difficult or annoying to implement. These can serve
as challenges for language and library implementations.


### Benchmarks

Examples which test the performance of algebraic effects and handlers. These can
serve as benchmarks for language and library implementations.
